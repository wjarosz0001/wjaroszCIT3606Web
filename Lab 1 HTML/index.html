            <p>Golf is a club-and-ball sport in which players use various clubs to hit balls into a series of holes on a course in as few strokes as possible. Golf, unlike most ball games, cannot and does not utilize a standardized playing area, and coping with the varied terrains encountered on different courses is a key part of the game.</p>
            <p>The modern game of golf originated in 15th-century Scotland. It is often considered to be the national sport of Scotland. The first written record of golf is James IV of Scotland's 1502 payment to a caddie for carrying his clubs and playing golf. The oldest golf course in the world is the Old Links at Musselburgh Racecourse, which dates from 1672. The standard 18-hole golf course was created at St Andrews in 1764.</p>
